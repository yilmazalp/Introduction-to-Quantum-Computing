# Introduction-to-Quantum-Computing
This notebook provides a clear, beginner-friendly yet mathematically rigorous introduction to quantum computing. It walks through the core concepts that underpin quantum information theory using both narrative and executable Python code.

## Contents
The notebook covers the following:
- Quantum States and Qubits: Dirac notation, normalization, and representation of quantum bits.
- Quantum Measurement: measurement operators, outcome probabilities, and post-measurement states.
- Quantum Gates: unitary transformations, the Pauli group, and their interpretations.
- Code Examples: Python code using NumPy to simulate quantum operations and measurements.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and Jupyter installed.
3. Install required packages:
   **pip install numpy matplotlib**
4. Open the notebook:
   **Jupyter notebook "Intro to QC.ipynb"**

## Prerequisites
- Basic linear algebra (vectors, complex numbers, inner products)
- Familiarity with Python and NumPy
- No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is strictly required.

## Learning goals
- How qubits are described and manipulated mathematically
- The probabilistic nature of quantum measurement
- The role of unitary gates in quantum evolution
- How to simulate basic quantum behavior using Python code
